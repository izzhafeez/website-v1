				<p class='header'>Here are my top 10 favourite Geography Channels in order</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/AtlasPro'>Atlas Pro</a></p>
				<p class='small'>I cannot stress how much I love this Geography channel. With high production quality and interesting hypothetical questions, this is one of my favourite channels overall. I truly enjoy the explanations that the channel gives, exploring sections of Geography I never knew existed. It is my number one source of inspiration for doing my own research. GOD tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/ibx2cat'>ibx2cat</a></p>
				<p class='small'>I've subscribed to this channel since 2016 and I still love the content! While this channel does also talk about geopolitics, I can safely say that the most interesting part is all the trivia. And it's jam-packed with it! Besides, this dude also makes Minecraft videos also so thats a plus. SS tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/CaspianReport'>Caspian Report</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Everything about this channel is Geopolitics. Very comprehensive, very high quality content. The script is always very well written and researched and I love just listening to it while falling asleep. Definitely check it out. SS tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/WonderWhy7439'>WonderWhy</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Phew this is a VERY old channel. Ever since 2013, I have been watching its videos. It presents interesting pieces of trivia and history, with several hypotheticals strewn in. Do check out the old videos as well. SS tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCylCbuzRsB92Gc1l8ru6VIg'>Met Office - Learn About Weather</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Meteorology at its finest. Specialising in everything weather, the channel presents simple-to-understand explanations of the various weather phenomena around us. Very cool indeed, but it has very few subscribers. SS tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_HIscbiDZM0dMX-nCksuA'>Casual Navigation</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Obviously, this channel prioritises ocean navigation over anything. Everywhere I go on the channel, all I see is boats. ALOT of boats. But that's what makes the channel awesome. All the terminology, all the physics, all are explained quite beautifully. S tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/GeographyNow'>Geography Now</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Another very old channel! Making its debut in 2013, Geography Now explores the countries in great detail. Scripts and research is done by the team as well as locals of the country, bringing forth the culture and true fascinating facts about the country. This community-driven channel is what makes it stand out above the others. S tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth'>Minute Earth</a></p>
				<p class='small'>Driven by explanations, this MinutePhysics spinoff uses simple but beautifully drawn animations to illustrate their points better. S tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA'>Geowizard</a></p>
				<p class='small'>A geography gaming channel, this dude is a legend at Geoguessr, making mad precision predictions on exactly where he is. Insanity overload with lots of real life experience as well. AS tier channel.</p>
				<p class='header'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA'>PBS Eons</a></p>
				<p class='small'>This channel talks about geographical events on the eon-scale, with prehistoric wildlife and interesting developments populating the channel. AS tier channel.</p>
